The arrest represents a dramatic escalation in the Epstein investigation, marking the first time a member of the British royal family has been detained in connection with the scandal. Andrew had previously stepped back from royal duties following his controversial BBC interview about his relationship with Epstein.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV85cUxNR2NsRDJTaHBzZ2VxSGRESWZYVVZwMkNPbnhtUG9TRS1pV045S3FwbU5rQV9yQlRWVUlDNnNJS3FaZjZjV0FfOUhTbzFJMHRqUEh3UFRMaWYzTXhEcHNRRVhuSU1CUy1xMXdMOXNkX2lpNEdmTzZRQWwydGV5Vk1yTVJ2STF5cnJTbjdyTUdXdmNNcmxJeFFNN1FEbHh3S1ZMRTR3UTBFLTU?oc=5\">AP News \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Estate Search</strong> \u2014 Police continued their search of Prince Andrew's former royal estate on Friday, a day after his arrest. The ongoing investigation at the property suggests authorities are looking for physical evidence related to his connections with Jeffrey Epstein. The search represents an unprecedented law enforcement action against a former member of the British royal family.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV85cUxQdWZiY0xxQU1OVUdjM1NFeDlCby12SGh2bFA3dGZoMnZ0WkJNdlk4QmYydnpHUFFWcVVWRjJkU2g0eE5BNU90Y3hDR1BmVUZ1YndZVFBkY0wzNDdZdmVMZ29vYW9WLUNvVlczelJaVUZYN1lmZ09iczRET3gxNXRVeFFzQkwxT3M?oc=5\">KCCI \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Virginia Giuffre</strong> \u2014 Virginia Giuffre has emerged as a pivotal figure in bringing accountability to Prince Andrew through her persistent allegations of sexual abuse when she was a minor. Her civil lawsuit against Andrew was settled out of court, but her testimony and advocacy work helped build the case that led to his arrest. Giuffre's courage in speaking out despite intense scrutiny has been credited with helping other victims find their voice in the Epstein scandal.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9EWEwtcTRxX2ZjVzhwc25hSVl1VTV5aExsbjRXc1lBQUNrOEFoX1pubTVkOEM5dkl3U21pWXZnUlJVZGd5WXVEX0tabnZkNHNIZ3pfMnlTeWFaZFpWZTJWS3JRc01JS2JkcVMya1VBMjdaV3FRLVhtTU5mZw?oc=5\">Axios \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Trump Response</strong> \u2014 Former President Donald Trump called Prince Andrew's arrest 'a shame,' sparking criticism given Trump's own documented connections to Jeffrey Epstein. The arrest has prompted renewed calls for accountability both in the UK and US, with advocates arguing that Andrew's detention should signal that no one is above the law regardless of their status. International observers are watching to see if this represents a turning point in holding powerful figures accountable.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV85cUxQRXdiZzBFb3BCNmhRMVI3TDdwaWJsTGlMcUg1ZmxlZUhETnQ1RjVrZnBPN1lfNV9mM0VZREpWUV9HUjhUa3Z3M3dtejBhaGt2cE1DNU5fRXZCdVRSdkxVY1AzZlFqMUlXMkJhU3JHelVqeUkzbGJZN05TYTB1RVNMa0ZadUlJeG5XWVpISU1wVnhocjRZUDAzWUdB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1oNGFaRHg2TlRFR0I0TTZvOTNRSHdzOHVYaXl0V1BBTVdXTUdPT2RULVo3eHdSVGxYV0Z1ZFRVc2FMU01mOS1DS1BsNEV2NjVsemVXTktKWHM4UFYzWnl2cWpWMnJCSkhyZjJnMzc5Y3diNDBiaTdoWUxmT08yTmQ4dVduaklhb285V0tnN2FlaXJ5SC1FOWd0YWdaNUN3Yw?oc=5\">CNBC \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Survivor Reaction</strong> \u2014 Epstein survivors are responding to Prince Andrew's arrest with cautious optimism, viewing it as a potential breakthrough in their long fight for justice.
