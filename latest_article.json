The deposition revealed an explosive moment when Wexner's attorney was caught on a hot mic saying he would \"f***ing kill\" someone. Republicans skipped the deposition, while Democrats claim Wexner funded much of Epstein's lifestyle and activities. The accusation represents a significant escalation in congressional scrutiny of the billionaire's relationship with the convicted sex offender.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/02/20/after-deposition-u-s-house-democrats-accuse-les-wexner-of-lying-about-epstein-ties/\">Ohio Capital Journal →</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Bill and Hillary Clinton</strong> — The Clintons are scheduled for closed-door depositions on February 26-27 in Chappaqua, New York, as part of the House investigation into Epstein connections. Hillary Clinton has accused the Trump administration of \"continuing a cover-up\" in how the depositions are being handled. In a significant political development, nine Democrats joined Republicans in voting to hold Bill Clinton in contempt, reflecting the bipartisan nature of the inquiry.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-epstein-files-cover-up-trump-house-oversight-committee-deposition/\">CBS News →</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Interlochen Arts School</strong> — An NPR investigation reveals that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell used the prestigious Interlochen Center for the Arts, a Michigan boarding school, to recruit some of their earliest victims. A woman testified that she was just 13 years old when she met Epstein and Maxwell at the school's summer camp in 1994, making this connection a disturbing example of how the pair targeted young victims at trusted educational institutions. The investigation sheds light on a lesser-known aspect of their predatory network.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/19/nx-s1-5707290/epstein-files-victims-interlochen-ghislaine-maxwell\">NPR →</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Ghislaine Maxwell and US Billionaires</strong> — Epstein survivor Annie Farmer is calling for the US Department of Justice to pursue billionaires connected to Epstein following the arrest of Prince Andrew in the UK. Farmer says the DOJ has left her with \"little faith they will do the right thing,\" noting that despite Prince Andrew's arrest, no high-profile American figures have been prosecuted in connection with the Epstein case. Maxwell claims she possesses information about 25 unnamed \"untouchable\" men who made secret settlements with victims, using this as leverage for clemency or a pardon.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5747381-us-billionaires-epstein-prosecution-pressure/\">The Hill →</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Names in Today's Report:</strong> <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/les-wexner.html\">Les Wexner</a> · <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/bill-clinton.html\">Bill Clinton</a> · <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/hillary-clinton.html\">Hillary Clinton</a> · <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/ghislaine-maxwell.html\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> · <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/annie-farmer.html\">Annie Farmer</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/daily-feb-21-2026.html\">Read the Full Roundup →</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com\">epsteinfilesdaily.com</a> for daily coverage tracking every name, every document, and every development in the Epstein files.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>", "theme_headline": "Democrats Accuse Les Wexner of Lying as Clinton Depositions Loom", "names": ["Les Wexner", "Bill Clinton", "Hillary Clinton", "Ghislaine Maxwell", "Annie Farmer"]}
