The arrest stems from scrutiny over his connections to Jeffrey Epstein and allegations that have kept him in the public eye. Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and duties in 2022, and this arrest represents a significant escalation in the ongoing investigation into his alleged misconduct.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.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?oc=5\">PBS \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> \u2014 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly exploring the possibility of removing former Prince Andrew from the line of succession to the British throne amid the ongoing Epstein investigation. This unprecedented move would represent a dramatic constitutional step and reflects the severity of the allegations surrounding Andrew's connections to the convicted sex offender. The consideration comes as Andrew faces mounting legal scrutiny and public pressure over his association with Epstein.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE1OT09rdm9hS0V6SHdCb1M5VUdIV01WUWRfMUR4YnlpaU01RFIzS1g1MTl2Z2tqQV9Jakh6am5JT2lCakxpczJZOGV4OWRYRFlOblQ1LWNUWFJ4V0dGRVZBR2xaV1VlUGZoUE9vS0lDMEY?oc=5\">Financial Times \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Andrew's Protection Officers</strong> \u2014 British police are actively contacting and questioning former protection officers who once guarded Prince Andrew, asking them what they saw or heard regarding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. This represents a significant expansion of the investigation as authorities seek firsthand accounts from those who would have been present during Andrew's interactions and travels. The questioning of protection officers suggests investigators are looking for concrete evidence and witness testimony that could corroborate or contradict existing allegations against the former prince.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV85cUxNVzRkV3lZVldRcEpOUi1mQjFCbTFIX1NoVG5ZOXA0YjlxT2FYM2o2RDUwd3VyM3JzWXB0MUNGNE1RVUdqTGQzNWlxWEV2OXBqckhxY0xwX240V2FUZHR3T2pudDFnOWRuQm84QjRzN0I3M3VrZDNrMGFUcHliSEpyOFhObUhrbFpw?oc=5\">The New York Times \u2192</a></li>\n\n<li><strong>Donald Trump</strong> \u2014 Former President Donald Trump commented on Prince Andrew's arrest, calling it 'a shame' as the case draws international attention and accountability calls from both the UK and US. Trump's response comes amid his own connections to the Epstein case and as the investigation continues to have global implications. The arrest has sparked renewed calls for accountability across international boundaries, with advocates pushing for justice in cases connected to Epstein's network of associates and enablers.\n<a style=\"display:block;font-size:14px;margin-top:4px\" href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV85cUxQRXdiZzBFb3BCNmhRMVI3TDdwaWJsTGlMcUg1ZmxlZUhETnQ1RjVrZnBPN1lfNV9mM0VZREpWUV9HUjhUa3Z3M3dtejBhaGt2cE1DNU5fRXZCdVRSdkxVY1AzZlFqMUlXMkJhU3JHelVqeUkzbGJZN05TYTB1RVNMa0ZadUlJeG5XWVpISU1wVnhocjRZUDAzWUdB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1oNGFaRHg2TlRFR0I0TTZvOTNRSHdzOHVYaXl0V1BBTVdXTUdPT2RULVo3eHdSVGxYV0Z1ZFRVc2FMU01mOS1DS1BsNEV2NjVsemVXTktKWHM4UFYzWnl2cWpWMnJCSkhyZjJnMzc5Y3diNDBiaTdoWUxmT08yTmQ4dVduaklhb285V0tnN2FlaXJ5SC1FOWd0YWdaNUN3Yw?oc=5\">CNBC \u2192</a></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Names in Today's Report:</strong> <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/prince-andrew.html\">Prince Andrew</a> \u00b7 <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/keir-starmer.html\">Keir Starmer</a> \u00b7 <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/names/donald-trump.html\">Donald Trump</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com/daily-feb-21-2026.html\">Read the Full Roundup \u2192</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://epsteinfilesdaily.com\">epsteinfilesdaily.com</a> for daily coverage tracking every name, every document, and every development in the Epstein files.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>", "theme_headline": "Prince Andrew Arrested in Epstein Probe as UK Considers Removing Him from Succession", "names": ["Prince Andrew", "Keir Starmer", "Donald Trump"]}
